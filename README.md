# Imagefap-Gallery-Downloader
Python script that downloads an entire Imagefap-gallery and keeps the filename intact.
It is a rewrite of the original, aiming to improve speed.

However, currently the script, althoug faster, results quite quickly in a 302-error loop.
I still need to find a solution for this, so use at your own risk!
