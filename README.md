# Imagefap-Gallery-Downloader
Python script that downloads an entire Imagefap-gallery and keeps the filename intact.

# Description
Enter the url of the gallery you wish to download, and the script does the rest.
It will create a folder with the name of the gallery (in the folder where this .py script is run), and download all hi-res images of the entire gallery into that folder with their original filename intact.
